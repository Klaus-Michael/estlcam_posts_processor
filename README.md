This is a Fusion 360 Post Processor to be used with Estlcam (https://www.estlcam.de/)

Its based on a Post Processor I found some time ago somewhere in the internet, I no longer know where I got it originally. At a later Point in time Christian from Estlcam posted the same file in a forum but at that time I was already using it for some month. So thats not the origin.
I did some modifications to the original file and therefore decided to upload it to git to keep track of my changes.
